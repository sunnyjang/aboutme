  <h1>Hey!<img src="me.jpg" width="350" height="500"></h1>

  <p>I&#146m pretty sure I already told you my name on the homepage, but I figure it&#146s worth repeating. You know. Just in case you weren&#146t paying attention or something.</p>
  
  <h1>sunny jang...</h1>

  <div class = "diff"
  <p>an optimist, a student at Penn, a daughter, and a photographer dedicated to capturing life&#146s most special moments.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>When I was 8 I broke my first camera. While I was sad that my parents were furious, I was more upset that my family lost all the photos we took that day.</p>
  

  <p>I saw the power in stopping to say &#146cheese&#146 every so often.</p>

  <p>Just like cheese is made by <i>carefully</i> curdling milk, I&#146ve learned to <i>carefully</i> care for my cameras. Throughout the past 10 years, I&#146ve been very lucky to travel the world and with that I&#146ve taken photos every step of the way.</p>
